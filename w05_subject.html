<h2>Introduction to Stem Cells</h2>
<p> Stem cells consist of the cells in our body that will differentiate to form specialized cells. So, what’s so special about Stem Cells?<p>

<h2> When are Stem Cells at play in our body?</h2>
<p>
There are many different applications of Stem cells in our body.
<ul>
<li> Embryonic Growth. During embryonic growth, stem cells rapidly proliferate to create the differentiated cells that will eventually become the various tissues and organs of our body.
<li> Repair and Damage. If a substantial amount of cells are lost, the body's stem cells will replace the cells that died in that region.
<li> Scenario 3: Regeneration: In some regenerating organisms, like flatworms and hydras, stem cells are crucial to enable the regeneration of specialized organs.

<h2> Stem Cell Potency </h2>

<p>
Cell Potency measures the ability of a stem cell to differentiate into other types of cells in the body. Below are different examples of cell potency:
<ul>
<li> Totipotency: Totipotent cells can differentiate into ANY specialized cell in the body, even extraembryonic cells! Fun fact: A totipotent cell can keep reproducing until it creates an entire organism.
<li> Pluripotency: Pluripotent cells can differentiate into all the specialized cells in an adult organism, meaning they can’t give rise to placental/extraembryonic cells.
<li> Multipotent: Multipotent cells give rise to multiple types of cells.
<li> Unipotent: Unipotent cells can give rise to only one type of cell
 /li>
 <ul>
<p>

<h2> Cell Potency and Embryonic Growth </h2>
<p> Cells have varying potencies depending on which state of human development they’re found in.
<ul>
<li> Totipotent Cells: The zygote is a totipotent cell, as it's the first cell in human development. The morula, a cluster of cells during early stages of embryonic development, also consists of totipotent cells.
<li> Pluripotent Cells: From a morula, a blastocyst develops. The embryonic stem cells in a blastocyst are pluripotent.
<li> Multipotent Cells: This includes germ layer stem cells.
The three germ layers in later stages of embryonic development — ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm — all have stem cells dedicated to form a certain part of the body.
<ul>
<li> Ectoderm: Skin and Nervous system
<li>Mesoderm: Skeletal and Muscular system
<li> Endoderm: Lung, gut, and liver
 /li>
<ul>
<li> Unipotent Cells: Somes examples include neural stem cells, which only give rise to neurons.
<ul>
 /li>

<h2> Stem Cell Treatment and Discoveries </h2>
<p> Because stem cells can differentiate and specialize, scientists use them to treat diseases and repair organs via stem cell transplants. In 2006, scientists even discovered induced pluripotent stem cells. Instead of relying on pluripotent stem cells from the blastocyst, they “reprogram” or genetically code skin or red blood cells to go back to an pluripotent state. Now, facilities could have access to a substantial supply of cells!
