<h2>Introduction to Stem Cells</h2>
<p>
Stem cells consist of our body's cells that will eventually differentiate to form specialized cells. 
<p>

<h2> When are Stem Cells at play in our body?</h2>
<p>
Stem cells are needed in a multitude of scenarios:
<ul>
<li> Scenario 1: Embryonic Growth. 
During embryonic growth, stem cells need to rapidly proliferate to create the differentiated cells that will form the various tissue and organs in our body. /li>
   <li> Scenario 2: Repair and Damage. If a substantial amount of cells are lost, then the body's stem cells are needed to repair and replace that area' </li>
<li> Scenario 3: Regeneration: In some regenerating organisms, stem cells are needed to regenerate limbs and certain specialized organs.
 <ul>
