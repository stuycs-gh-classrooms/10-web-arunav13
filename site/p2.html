  <h2> Stem Cell Discoveries and Research </h2>
  <p>
    Because stem cells are vital in keep us healthy and alive, there
  has been a recent surge in new discoveries that rely on innovative
  research on stem cells.
  <p>

    <h2> Bone Marrow Transplants </h2>


    <p>  Bone marrow or Stem Cell transplants rely on taking
      healthy stem cells from the bone marrow and transporting it to the patient.
      These tranplants are especially useful for cancer and chemotherapy patients.
      During chemotherapy, patients loose healthy cells. They can benefit from
      transplants enabling new cells to improve growth. There are two types of Bone Marrow
      Transplants:
      <ul>
      <li> Autologous Transplanation: This transplant involves taking healthy stem cells
          from the patient itself. They're removed, filtered, and returned to the patient.
      </li>
      <li> Allogenic Transplantions: This transplant involves removing stem
          cells from a doner, such as a family family. </li>
      </ul>

      <p>

    <h2> Induced Pluripotency </h2>
  <p> Because stem cells can differentiate and specialize,
    scientists use them to treat diseases aand repair organs via stem cell transplants.
    In 2006, scientists even discovered induced pluripotent stem cells.
    Instead of relying on pluripotent stem cells from the blastocyst, they “reprogram” or genetically code skin or red blood cells to go back to an pluripotent state.
    Now, hospitals and health facilities could have access to a substantial supply of cells!
    This also makes targeted treatments easier, where scientists can induce specialized cells
    needed to treat a patient's conditions.
    Individuals with a health condition -- like stroke, burns, and heart disease --
    can benefit from such therapies.
