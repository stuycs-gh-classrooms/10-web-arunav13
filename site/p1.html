<h1> Stem Cell Potency </h1>

  <h2> What is  Cell Potency? </h2>
    <p>
  Cell Potency measures the ability of a stem cell to
  differentiate into other types of cells in the body.
  Below are different examples of cell potency:
  <ul>
  <li> Totipotency: Totipotent cells can differentiate into ANY specialized cell in the body, even extraembryonic cells! Fun fact: A totipotent cell can keep reproducing until it creates an entire organism. </li>
  <li> Pluripotency: Pluripotent cells can differentiate into all the specialized cells in an adult organism, meaning they can’t give rise to placental/extraembryonic cells. </li>
  <li> Multipotent: Multipotent cells give rise to multiple types of cells. </li>
  <li> Unipotent: Unipotent cells can give rise to only one type of cell  </li>
   </ul>
  <p>

  <h2> Types of Potency </h2>
  <p> Cells have varying potencies depending on which state of human development they’re found in.
  <ul>
  <li> Totipotent Cells: The zygote is a totipotent cell, as it's the first cell in human development. The morula, a cluster of cells during early stages of embryonic development, also consists of totipotent cells.
  An example of a totipotent cell is a zygote. </li>
  <li> Pluripotent Cells: From a morula, a blastocyst develops. The embryonic stem cells in a blastocyst are pluripotent. </li>
  <li> Multipotent Cells: This includes germ layer stem cells. </li>
  Fun fact: In most vertebrates, stem cells that are pluripotent or totipotent
    are rare!
  </ul>
    <p>

    <h2> Embryonic Growth and Stem Cell Development </h2>
      <p> The three germ layers in later stages of embryonic development — ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm — all have stem cells dedicated to form a certain part of the body.
  <ul>
  <li> Ectoderm: Skin and Nervous system </li>
  <li> Mesoderm: Skeletal and Muscular system </li>
  <li> Endoderm: Lung, gut, and liver </li>
  <li> Unipotent Cells: Somes examples include neural stem cells, which only give rise to neurons. </li>
  </ul>
