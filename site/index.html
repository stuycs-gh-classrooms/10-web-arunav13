<h2>Introduction to Stem Cells</h2>
<p> Stem cells consist of the cells in our body that will differentiate to form specialized cells.
These cells are involved in embryonic growth, regeneration, and repair. They're even
leveraged by scientists to create new treatments>

<h2> When are Stem Cells at play in our body?</h2>
<p>
There are many different applications of Stem cells in our body.
<ul>
<li> Embryonic Growth: During embryonic growth, stem cells rapidly proliferate to create the differentiated cells that will eventually become the various tissues and organs of our body.  </li>
<li> Repair and Damage: If a substantial amount of cells are lost, the body's stem cells will replace the cells that died in that region.  </li>
<li> Regeneration: In some regenerating organisms, like flatworms and hydras, stem cells are crucial to enable the regeneration of specialized organs.  </li>
 </ul>

  <h2> Stem Cells in Action <h2>
<p>
One powerful examples of stem cells in action is stem cells in the bone marrow. These cells differentiate into 3 key types of cells:
<ul>
<li> Red Blood Cells: </li>
<li> White Blood Cells or Immune Cells </li>
<li> Platelets: These are fragments of large cells called megakaryocitesm, which are clotting factors in the blood T</li>
 </ul>
