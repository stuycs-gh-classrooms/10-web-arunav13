<h1> Stem Cells in Action </h1>

<h2> When are Stem Cells at play in our body? </h2>
<div class="category2" >
There are many different applications of Stem cells in our body.
<ul>
<li> Embryonic Growth: During embryonic growth, stem cells rapidly proliferate to create the differentiated cells that will eventually become the various tissues and organs of our body.  </li>
<li> Repair and Damage: If a substantial amount of cells are lost, the body's stem cells will replace the cells that died in that region.  </li>
<li> Regeneration: In some regenerating organisms, like flatworms and hydras, stem cells are crucial to enable the regeneration of specialized organs.  </li>
 </ul>
</div>

<h2> Types of Stem Cells </h2>
<div class="category3" >
  There are two types of Stem cells: embryonic and adult stem cells.
  <ul>
    <li>  Embryonic Stem Cells: These cells give rise to all cell types in the embryo  </li>
      <li>  Adult Stem Cells: These cells are involved in repair during degeneration of
        bone, teeth, cartilage, skin, and the heart.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>


  <h2> Bone Marrow </h2>
<div class="category4" >
One powerful examples of stem cells in action is stem cells in the bone marrow.
Stem cells exist in the bone marrow (in addition to the skin, heart, teeth, and brain).
When they differentiate, they leave the bone marrow and enter the bloodstream.
Bone marrow stem cells differentiate into 3 key types of cells:
<ul>
<li> Red Blood Cells: </li>
<li> White Blood Cells or Immune Cells </li>
<li> Platelets: These are fragments of large cells called megakaryocitesm, which are clotting factors in the blood </li>
 </ul>
